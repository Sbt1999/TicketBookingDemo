Absolutely, Shobhit — yes, you can (and should) use this in your project explanation.
It shows that you understand performance and concurrency trade-offs.

✅ How to say it in your project explanation:

Initially, ticket booking used synchronized blocks to update shared counters,
but under high thread contention, it became a performance bottleneck.

To optimize this, I replaced synchronized with AtomicInteger, which uses lock-free
atomic operations (CAS) to safely update the booked count.

This reduced locking overhead, improved throughput, and ensured safe concurrent
access without blocking other threads.

🧠 Bonus (what interviewers might ask):'

Question ->
Why was synchronized a bottleneck?

Your Answer ->
It forces threads to wait for the lock, even for  small operations like incrementing a counter.

Question ->
What did AtomicInteger improve?

Your Answer ->
It performs atomic updates without blocking — making it faster and more scalable.

Question ->
How is it thread-safe?

Your Answer ->
It uses low-level CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations that ensure only one thread can succeed in updating the value at a time.

🎯 Use this line confidently:
I optimized thread contention by replacing synchronized counter updates with AtomicInteger,
improving concurrency performance in ticket booking.
